# Library Management System Project

The **Library Management System** is a desktop application designed to streamline and manage the operations of a library. The system is developed using **Python** and its libraries, with a focus on providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for librarians and staff to manage books, members, and transactions effectively.

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Library Management System  
**Technologies Used**: Python, Tkinter  
**Author**: Muhammad Jalal  

## Features

- **Book Management**: Add, update, and delete books from the library catalog.
- **Member Management**: Register new members, view member details, and update member information.
- **Transaction Tracking**: Keep track of borrowed and returned books, including due dates and late fees.
- **Search Functionality**: Search for books or members by various criteria like title, author, and member name.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system for authorized access to the system.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built using **Tkinter** to ensure ease of use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Library Management System locally, you need the following:

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure that Python is installed on your machine.
- **Tkinter**: A library for GUI development (usually comes pre-installed with Python).
- **Other Dependencies**: Install any additional libraries if needed (e.g., SQLite for database management).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jalal1122/Library-Management-System-Project.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Library-Management-System-Project
    ```

3. Ensure that you have Python installed and Tkinter is available. If Tkinter is not installed, you can install it using:
    ```bash
    pip install tk
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

5. The GUI will launch, and you can start managing your library system.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
